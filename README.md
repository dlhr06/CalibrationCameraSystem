<h1 align="center" id="title">Calibration Camera System: Point of interest projection with laser and white light 📷 </h1>


This repository is about a calibration camera system project using two point-of-interest projection methods: A laser light and White light. This project is a solution using easily accessible devices and an uncontrolled experimental environment | Degree project of Master in Computer Systems by [Instituto Tecnológico Superior de Misantla.](https://misantla.tecnm.mx/)

## Dataset images content 🗄📸
The content of the dataset of images using two point-of-interest projection methods proposed is based on the following elements:
  1. Calibration system using laser projection
  2. Calibration system using white ligth projection
  3. Calibration system using a chessboard 
* Python scripts using digital image processing methods to obtain the location of points of interest in the 2D coordinate system will be available soon.
