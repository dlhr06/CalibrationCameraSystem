# Calibration Camera System: point of interest projection with laser and white light 📷

This repository is about a calibration camera system project usin a point-of-interest projection by two devices: A laser pointer and white light project. This project is a solution of camera calibration system using easily accessible devices and an uncontrolled experimental environment | Degree project Master in Computer Systems by [Instituto Tecnológico Superior de Misantla.](https://misantla.tecnm.mx/). 

## Allied research institutions
 * [Consejo Nacional de Humanidades Ciencias y Tecnologías (CONAHCYT)](https://conahcyt.mx/)
 * [Centro de Investigaciones en Óptica A.C.  Campus León (CIO)](https://www.cio.mx/)

## Private dataset content
The content of the dataset of this degree project is based on the following elements. 
* Dataset of images using the proposed calibration system and the two projection methods at two different distance settings.
  1. Camera system at a distance greater than 100 cm from the reference plane.
  2. Camera system of less than 80 cm from the reference plane.
* Python scripts using digital image processing techniques to obtain the location of points of interest in the 2D coordinate system.
